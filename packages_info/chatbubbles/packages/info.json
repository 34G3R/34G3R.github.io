  "description": "<div>ChatBubbles for IOS. <br> <br> • ChatBubbles is a Tweak to get ChatHeads on IOS. From Messenger to iMessage/Sms  - this is still in early stages but will be updated eventually, with more features, bug fixes & increased stability. so far it is only avalible to IOS 13-14.2, i recommend downloading CallBubbles as its the same but works with calls. <br> <br> • ChatBubbles has minor issues which i will list here with fix. <br> <br> • once installed if you recieve a call and dont answer you will respring to safemode. or if you close the bubble while one comes through. <br> <br> • <br> <br> • FIX • <br> <br> • remove the messenger tweak if youd like to use without error <br> <br> • once i have found a fix i will update, you can try use tweaks similar to lifegaurd to try respring/force safemode using volume buttons (INSTALL SUBSTRATE SAFEMODE!!).</div>",
